    <p>I am a researcher at the intersection of the social studies of science &amp; technology and computer science. Currently I am finishing my <strong>master's degree in <a href="https://sts.univie.ac.at">Science &amp; Technology Studies at University of Vienna</a></strong> under the supervision of <a href="https://sts.univie.ac.at/ueber-uns/ulrike-felt/">Ulrike Felt</a> where I work on how pracitioners address uncertainty when using crowd sourcing to annotate/label data sets. I have also been researching the so-called <strong>'AMS Algorithm'</strong>, an algorithm that is used by the Austrian Public Employment Agency to predict the prospects of job seekers and based on that allocate resources. Finally, being a disciplinary hybrid myself, I am currently completing a small project on <strong>inter- and transdisciplinary teaching</strong> at four higher education institutions in Vienna that are member of the <a href="https://cts.wien/">Center for Technology &amp; Society</a>.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I am being trained as <strong>field ornithologist</strong> by <a href="https://birdlife.at">BirdLife Austria</a> where I learn how to identify birds and about their ecology. This is to contribute to the <a href="https://birdlife.at/page/monitoring-der-brutvogel">monitoring of bird biodiversity and population developments</a>, as birds (and other life forms) are increasingly under stress due to climate change, intensifying agriculture and other forms of habitat destruction.</p>
<p>I was <strong>University Assistant (prae doc) at the Technical University of Vienna</strong> from 2019-2021 at the <a href="https://media.tuwien.ac.at">Multidisciplinary Design &amp; User Research Group</a> where I taught courses on <em>Critical Algorithm Studies</em>, <em>Digital Transformation</em> and co-supervised student projects that used <em>human-centered design</em> processes.</p>
<p>While I have been focusing on the <em>social</em> study of algorithmic and data-driven systems, I have originally been trained as a computer scientist and have been working in that field for several years.</p>
<p>Before joining TU Wien I was working several years in <strong>software research &amp; development</strong> that revolved around <em>natural language processing</em> and <em>knowledge representation</em>. During that time I was designing and programming scalable software that involved <em>big data</em> techniques, including near-real time processing, relational databases, document-based databases, search engines and graph stores. My main tasks were (re)writing performant and scalable code and text understanding across languages. Some of what I contributed to powers, e.g., the <a href="https://unep.ecoresearch.net/weblyzard/">United Nations Environment Programme's Web Intelligence dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>I completed my master and bachelor degrees at Technical University of Vienna, with my study programmes Software &amp; Information Engineering and Computational Intelligence focusing on algorithms, data structures and artificial intelligence (i.e. logic, knowledge representation, and machine learning). I also took several courses in information security and conducted my master thesis on information extraction from underground market places at the <a href="https://iseclab.org/">International Secure Systems Lab</a>.</p>
